# rock_paper-scissors
I tried to make a game where a player and a computer would take turns. And turns would not happen instantaneously. After a few tries I realized it is beyond my level. Somehow I managed to get kind of that result. But my js code became really messy and ugly. So I changed rock icon to pile of poo. 
Tried to remove listeners from a nodelist and failed. So i assigned  listeners individually.  
Used icons from fontawesome.com.
